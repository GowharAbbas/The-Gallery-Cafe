    <p>  Our choice of books reflects our personality and our intellect.
         Books tell us about new things and enrich our knowledge. 
         They open the doors to a beautiful world and quicken our imagination. 
         They give us company and drive away our boredom. 
         They are friends to the ones who are lonely. 
         They also act as companions to the deserted. 
         They brighten our lives by giving joy to the ones who are joyless and give happiness and pleasure. 
         Books are our true friends because they make us better, wiser and happier.
